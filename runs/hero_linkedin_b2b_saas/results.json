      "output_text": "I’ve learned that revenue forecasting is less about perfectly predicting the future and more about creating a clear, shared view across teams. Early in my career, forecasts were often a guessing game—numbers pulled from spreadsheets with little context or alignment. That changed when I started using a platform that brought sales, finance, and RevOps data into one place. It didn’t magically fix everything overnight, but it made conversations more factual and less about opinions. Forecasts became a starting point for discussion, not an endpoint. For anyone wrestling with disconnected data and missed targets, bringing those pieces together can make a real difference. How do you keep your forecasting grounded and collaborative?",

      "output_text": "“I don’t need another forecasting tool. Our spreadsheets get the job done.”\n\nI hear this a lot from revenue leaders. It makes sense—spreadsheets feel familiar and flexible, especially when you’re juggling multiple priorities. But my experience is that complexity can quietly creep in. When forecasts live in scattered sheets, updates become a game of telephone; assumptions get lost or misunderstood; and collaboration often means a flurry of emails chasing the latest version.\n\nIt’s not about replacing what works but acknowledging where accuracy and alignment can quietly slip as a company scales. For me, the question is less about tools and more about how we create a shared source of truth that stakeholders can trust without constant firefighting.\n\nHow do you approach forecasting when growth and complexity pull in different directions?",
